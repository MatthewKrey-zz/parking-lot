# Parking Lot 

Being a super green software dev, someone asks you, now that you know how to program, if you can help them to write a piece of software to help manage their new parking lot business. </br>
</br>
Also being a budding entrepreneur (or just having student loans to pay), you absolutely can. </br>
</br>
Let's first make some assumptions about what we are going to build for our MVP. </br>
</br>
1) Assume single-level parking lot with n parking spaces </br>
2) Assume hourly rate of $20.00/hr </br>
3) Assume homogenous parking space size (e.g. no difference for Compact Cars, SUV, Handicapped, etc.) </br>
